### 1. Sentiment-Based Trading Strategy for Tesla (TSLA)

**File:** `sentiment_trading_strategy.ipynb`

This project investigates the correlation between the public sentiment expressed in Elon Musk's tweets and the daily stock returns of Tesla (TSLA).

#### Methodology:
1.  **Data Collection:**
    * **Stock Data:** Daily historical price data for TSLA is downloaded for 2023 using the `yfinance` library.
    * **Sentiment Data:** A CSV file containing Elon Musk's tweets is loaded.
2.  **Sentiment Analysis:**
    * Each tweet's text is analyzed using `TextBlob` to calculate a **sentiment polarity score** (ranging from -1.0 for negative to +1.0 for positive).
    * Tweets are grouped by day, and an average daily sentiment score is calculated.
3.  **Data Merging & Analysis:**
    * The daily stock returns are merged with the calculated daily sentiment scores.
    * The **Pearson correlation coefficient** is computed to measure the linear relationship between sentiment and returns.
4.  **Visualization:**
    * **Time Series Plot:** Compares daily returns against daily sentiment over time.
    * **Scatter Plot:** Visualizes the direct relationship between sentiment scores and stock returns.
    * **7-Day Rolling Average:** Smooths the data to identify underlying trends.
    * **Correlation Heatmap:** Shows the correlation between returns, sentiment, closing price, and volume.
    * **Bar Chart:** Compares the average daily returns on days with overall positive sentiment versus days with negative sentiment.

#### Key Findings:
The analysis reveals a **weak positive correlation (0.1383)** between the daily average sentiment of Elon Musk's tweets and TSLA's daily returns for the period studied. While not strong enough to be a standalone trading signal, it suggests that overwhelmingly positive sentiment may have a slight positive influence on price action.

### 2. Time-Series Forecasting of TSLA Daily Returns

**File:** `TSLA_daily_returns_1000shares.ipynb`

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the daily return of Tesla (TSLA) stock using a wide range of market indicators as features. The model is a **Random Forest Regressor**, chosen for its robustness in handling complex, non-linear relationships in financial data.

#### Methodology:
1.  **Feature Engineering:**
    * **Market Data:** Daily closing prices for over 1500 NASDAQ stocks and key market indices (`^GSPC`, `^IXIC`, `^VIX`, `^TNX`), commodities (`CL=F`), and cryptocurrencies (`BTC-USD`) are downloaded.
    * **Technical Indicators:** Custom-calculated indicators for TSLA are created:
        * 50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
        * Bollinger Bands (Upper and Lower)
        * Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    * **Lagged Features:** All market returns and technical indicators are lagged by one day to ensure the model only uses past information to predict future returns.
2.  **Model Training:**
    * A **Random Forest Regressor** from `scikit-learn` is trained on 5 years of historical data.
    * The target variable is the next-day's return for TSLA.
    * The features are the lagged daily returns of all assets and the lagged technical indicators.
3.  **Single-Day Backtest:**
    * The model is trained on data up to September 17, 2025.
    * It then uses the data from September 18, 2025, to predict the return for **September 19, 2025**.
    * The prediction is compared against the actual, known return for that day to evaluate performance.

#### Backtest Result (for 2025-09-19):
* **Predicted Return:** `+1.3174%`
* **Actual Return:** `+2.2118%`

This result demonstrates the model's ability to correctly predict the direction of the price movement for the tested day, although the magnitude was underestimated.
